PROJECT 1 By Pam, Makhi and Parmeet

For Project 1, We work with our group to find and analyze a dataset of our choice.
For this project, we focused on Healthcare field of Public health informatics for Covid19 data.
Exploratory data analysis is important for understanding the following healthcare considerations:
•	Predicting and diagnosing illnesses
•	Improving patient safety
•	Reducing time to diagnosis
•	Increasing our understanding of disease risks and causes
•	Developing stronger prevention strategies



Title of Our Project
Early Indicators of Covid 19 Updates in 14 States of United States
Group 3: Pam, Makhi and Parmeet
Project Description/Outline:
The early indicators represent a portion of national Covid 19 tests and emergency visits. It is important to see the rates of COVID-19-associated hospitalizations each year
COVID-NET is a population-based surveillance system. Population-based surveillance is the active collection, analysis, and interpretation of data on a population in a specified geographic area.
Tracking COVID-19-associated hospitalization rates helps public health professionals understand trends in virus circulation, estimate disease burden, and respond to outbreaks. understand trends in virus circulation, estimate disease burden, and respond to outbreaks.

Project Questions
COVID-NET collects surveillance data on laboratory-confirmed, COVID-19-associated hospitalizations among children and adults. Data are collected and reported from a network of sites in acute-care hospitals across 98 counties in 13 states.
Calculating Hospitalization Rates
To calculate COVID-19-associated hospitalization rates, COVID-NET collects the following data from identified cases:
•	Age
•	Sex
•	Race and ethnicity
•	County of residence
•	Date of hospital admission
•	Date of SARS-CoV-2 test
•	Positive SARS-CoV-2 test result
Hospitalization rates are calculated as the number of residents in a surveillance area who are hospitalized with laboratory-confirmed COVID-19, divided by the total population estimate for that area. 
We will be going through these factors related to COVID-19 deaths.
COVID-NET Surveillance Area
COVID-NET currently comprises 98 counties in the 14 states participating in the Emerging Infections Program (EIP) and the Influenza Hospitalization Surveillance Project (IHSP). The participating states are California, Colorado, Connecticut, Georgia, Maryland, Michigan, Minnesota, New Mexico, New York, Ohio, Oregon, Tennessee, and Utah.
Data Sets to be Used:
              We will be using a data set found on CDC. The data set is called COVID 19 data tracker. 
Rough Breakdown of Tasks:
•	Use Pandas to clean data
•	Create Jupyter notebook to describe our process through the clean up and data exploration
•	Choose 3-8 factors that we now have clean information about
•	Create Jupyter notebook to illustrate the final data analysis
•	Use this final data analysis to guide in what graphs to make using Matplotlib (create 6-8 visualizations, possibly 2 per question)
•	Save PNG images of visualizations for class and instructional team
•	Write-up summary of major findings. 
o	Heading for each question
o	Short description of findings
o	Relevant plots
o	Power Point Presentation
To Fulfill the requirements for this project we as a group team 3 fetched the data by exploring the site from CDC CDC COVID Data Tracker: COVID-NET Hospitalization Surveillance Network.
We imported the CSV file and for visualization, analysis used Jupyter notebook.
We as team worked all together by zoom meetings almost everyday and explored very interesting findings about Covid19.
We have separately attached the observations and analysis file.
